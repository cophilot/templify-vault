## How to use templify?

When you can see this file, you have already initialized templify in this project. You can now create your own templates and generate new files from them.

### Create a new template

To create a new template, you can use the following command:

```bash
tpy new <template-name>
```

This will create a new folder in the `.templates` folder with the given name. You can now add files to this folder that will be used to generate new files from this template.
Inside the folder you will also find a `.templify` file. This file is used by templify to generate new files from this template. Please open and read the file to learn more about how to use it.

### Load templates 

You can also load templates from a GitHub repository into your project:

```bash
tpy load <url>
```

The url should point to a folder inside a GitHub repository. Each folder inside there will be imported as a template in your _.templates_. See the [templify-vault](https://github.com/cophilot/templify?tab=readme-ov-file#templify-vault) for more informations.

### List all templates

To list all templates, you can use the following command:

```bash
tpy list
```

### Generate a new file from a template

To generate a new file from a template, you can use the following command:

```bash
tpy generate <template-name> <given-name>
```

This will create a new file from the given template in the current project folder with the given name.
