This repository contains default templates for several technologies using [templify](https://github.com/cophilot/templify). You can add these templates to your project by using the templify CLI and the `load` command.

You can also create your own _templify-vault_ by using this repository as a template or by creating a new repository with the same structure. _Note: When you want to use the `load` command, the repository must be public and you have to use the `https` link._
